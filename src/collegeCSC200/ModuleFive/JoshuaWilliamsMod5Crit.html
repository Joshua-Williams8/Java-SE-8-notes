<p>I am making this web page to show a list of cars that I used
  to/currently drive, and a list of cars I would eventually love to own.
  I chose to make my website's topic this because I wanted to show a
  chronological list for the ordered list, and a list that's order doesn't matter
  for my unordered one.
  The first list will be an ordered list, from the first car I bought, to my current.
  The next list will be an unordered list of cars I would get if I won the lottery,
  or could somehow afford. With that being said if you know someone who's hiring a
 java developer and paying them an insane amount, here a link to my <b><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/josh-williams8/">LinkedIn.</a></b>
<h3>Cars that I used to own/currently, in order from First Car to Current:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Mitsubishi Lancer (Not the cool one)</li>
  <li>Kia Stinger Base</li>
  <li>Dodge Charger Rallye (Basically an SXT)</li>
  <li>Kia Stinger GT Limited</li>
  <li>Kia Stringer GT 2 (Current Vehicle)</li>
</ol>
