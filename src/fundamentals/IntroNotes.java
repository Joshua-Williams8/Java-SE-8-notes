//  NOTE: A computer program is a SET OF INSTRUCTIONS that run on a computer or other digtal device.
//  Machine level - consist of binary instructions (1s and 0s) binary
//  High-level code (readable) is what most programs are written in., this has to be tranlated to machine code before it can run it.

//  NOTE:
//  Compilers turns the high-level code into machine code.
//  Compilers need to beable to speak the same language as the computer or platform.
//  So you can't use a Linux compiler for a windows computer.
// Compiler compiles the code into an executable file,
//  NOTE: Libraries
//  There's also project libraries that help simplfy the process, so you don't have recreate code/procedures over and over again
//  Library files are linked to a specify program for a specfic system/platform

//  NOTE: Java language is PLATFORM INDEPENDENT, unlike C and C++
//  Which means it DOES NOT need ot be compiled 3 times for 3 different platforms, like the others would
//  As long as you a JVM (Java Virtual Machine) installed on the computer it doesn't matter
//  NOTE High-level to compiler to machine level

//  NOTE: Java is the number 1 language in the world.
//  JRE = Java run time evenviroment, this is used for END USERS to run applications
//  JDK is used by developers Java development Kit (Could also be known as SDK(Software...)
//  All non-smart phones, (feature phones?) run java
//  JVM = JAva Virtual MAchine, (Used to run java right?)
//  MSA API is the mobile Software APplication used to create user interfaces on portable devices.

//  NOTE Java SE Stuff (standard edition)
//  Is used to develop applets that run within web browsers and applications that run on desktops
//  NOTE applets vs application
//  Applets launched in the browser vs
//  Applications are launched within an OS as a standalone program

//  NOTE Java EE Stuff (Enterprise edition)
//  Used to create LARGE enterprise, server-side, and client-side distributed applications
//  Expands off of the SE platform, by extending it with more APIs (Application Programming interfaces) that support the needs of a large scale, high performance environment.

//  NOTE JAVA ME Micro Edition
//  Used to create applications for resourc-constrained consumer devices(Phones blu-ray players etc)

//  NOTE Java Card
//  Used to secure information, normally found on a smart card. Even mobile phone SIM cards

//  NOTE PLC (Product Life Cycle) Stages

//  notenum 1. Analysis
//  Process of looking at a problem that you want to solve with your software., You want to CLEARLY Define the program you want to solve, or the application you want to build.
//  The scope of the project, (or boundry of a program), is the big picture of every aspect of the software you want to develop.

// notenum 2. Design
// Process of applying the findings you made during the analysis stage to the design of th product
//  Make the specifications for the products or components in your system.


// notenum 3. Development
// When we take those blueprints or specifications from the design stage to create the actual components.
//
// notenum 4. Testing
// We are testing to ensure that the individual components, and the product as a whole meet the requirements.
//  Usually done by a team of dedicated testers, who were NOT involved in the actual development of the product.
//  This is done to make sure it's tested OBJECTIVELY, without any bias.
// notenum 5. Implementation
// Where we deliver the software product and make it available to customers.
// notenum 6. Maintenance
// Problems are fixed and the product is re-released through patches(for minor fixes or updates) and in the form of new versions when there are enough changes that a new version is merited.
// notenum 7. End-of-Life (EOL)
// Carry out all the essential task to ensure that the customers and employees are aware that a product is no longer being sold.
