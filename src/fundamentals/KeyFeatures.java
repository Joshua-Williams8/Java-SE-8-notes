public class KeyFeatures {
//  It is not platform dependent(aka platform independent)
//  It is OBJECT ORIENTED - this means you can create and manage data objects and they cn be referenced in very useful ways.
//  High level code to complier becomes Java Bytecode(Machine readable) which can be used on any platform, cause it's interpreted by a JVM or Java virtual machine.
//  Java is refered to as an INTERPRETED LANGUAGE
//  JVM + the librabries with pre-written classes = JRE, Java Runtime environment

//  NOTE Benifits of OOP Language
// Modularity (Source code of an object is indpenedent of the source code for other objects.
//  Information hiding (It does it by only allowing the JRE to interact with an object's methods. The details of it's internal implementation stay hidden.)
//  Code reuse
//  Maintainability (You can fix problems fairly easily, ex: if an object has an issue you can create another slightly different one then use it instead

// NOTE Compiling and running a Java Program (Basics)
// .java (Source code is contained in here)
//  javac (The source code is compilted by javac.
//  .class (The result is a .class file(byte code)
//  java (The class file is executed by the JRE JAva run time

// NOTE Compiling a program
// 1. Go to the directory where the source code files are stored.
//  2. Enter the command below for each .java file you want to compile
//  NOTE Syntax:
// javac SayHello.java
//  (The example class name would be SayHello.class fyi)

//  NOTE Executing(Testing) a program
// 1. Go to the directory where the class files are stored.
//  2. Enter the following for the class file that contains the  MAIN method:

//  Syntax: java <classname>
//  java sayHello (DO NOT SPECIFY THE CLASS THIS TIME)
//  the output would come out from this file, in this case Hello World:

//  NOTE Java programs are simply plain text files.
