For Radix
Big O
Our method uses a loop that goes for the input array length.

Then call on the special countSort.
The amount of times countSort is called depends on the largest value's digit count.
The digit count is denoted by "d".
n + d

Inside of countSort we use two loops that go for the length of the input array.
We also have a loop for the countArray that gathers the cumulative sums.
This loop will end after 10 runs.
(n + n + 10)

n for "for loop" array length runs
d for the digit loop runs for the max sized number amount of digits
10 for the countArray cumulative sum loop

n + d(n + n + 10)
n + d(2n + 10)
n + 2dn + 20d
2dn + n + 20d
For Big O
Big O (n*d)
